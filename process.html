                The creation of my website was inspired by a combination of diverse influences, design principles, and industry trends. These inspirations guided the conceptualization, design, and development of the website, shaping its overall aesthetic, functionality, and user experience. Some key inspirations include:

            <p>
                In designing my website, I have prioritized accessibility in accordance with WCAG 2.0 standards. I recognize the importance of ensuring that individuals with disabilities can access and navigate my site effectively. My approach to accessibility involves a comprehensive consideration of diverse user needs, encompassing factors such as limited vision, hearing impairments, cognitive limitations, mobility challenges, and more.
